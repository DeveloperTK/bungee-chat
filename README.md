# BungeeChat
A small BungeeCord plugin to sync chat across all servers

## Features:
- Syncs normal chat across all servers
- Chat Events in Spigot Plugins don't work anymore (it's not a bug, it's a feature)
- If your message starts with `!`, it won't be sent to other servers
- If your message starts with `âˆ†`, the character after that will be a color code (only one can be used, must be at the beginning)
